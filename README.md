<h2>About</h2>
During the fall semester of 2018, I took a course in Data Mining as part of the requirements for my minor in Computer Science. This course was a dual-enrollemnt course consisting of both graduate level students and undergraduates. The projects were completed using Jupyter Notebook and were completed in Python. As a part of this repository you will find notes, weekly activities, and projects. All activities include video explainations. There is also an ethics paper discussing plagerism in programming. All work in these files remain as they were completed and submitted during the course.
